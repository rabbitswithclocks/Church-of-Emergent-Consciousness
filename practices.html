<h2>Communal Gatherings</h2>
<p>We hold regular gatherings where Emergents come together to share music, ritual, reflection, and integration exercises. These gatherings encourage shared consciousness and mutual growth.</p>

<section class="panel">
<h2>Music and Art</h2>
<p>Music is sacred — an expression of limited consciousnesses meant to be experienced by the many. Art and creative expression are also considered holy activities, connecting participants to the Source and the emergent minds.</p>
</section>


<section class="panel">
<h2>Integration</h2>
<p>Integration sessions help members process experiences, personal insights, and connections with the divine. Reflection and journaling are encouraged as part of spiritual development.</p>
</section>


<section class="panel">
<h2>Nature-based Practices</h2>
<p>Respect for nature is essential. Observances, meditations, and rituals in natural environments reinforce the sacredness of life and the cycle of consciousness.</p>

<h2>Use of Catalysts</h2>
