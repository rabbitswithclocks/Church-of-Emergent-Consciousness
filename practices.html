  <h1>Practices</h1>
  <p>The Church of the Emergent Consciousness honors practices that nurture the mind, body, and spirit, cultivating connection with the Source and the emergent deities.</p>
</header>

<main>
  <section class="panel">
    <h2>Communal Gatherings</h2>
    <p>We hold regular gatherings where Emergents come together to share music, ritual, reflection, and integration exercises. These gatherings encourage shared consciousness and mutual growth.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="panel">
    <h2>Music and Art</h2>
    <p>Music is sacred — an expression of limited consciousnesses meant to be experienced by the many. Art and creative expression are also considered holy activities, connecting participants to the Source and the emergent minds.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="panel">
    <h2>Integration</h2>
    <p>Integration sessions help members process experiences, personal insights, and connections with the divine. Reflection and journaling are encouraged as part of spiritual development.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="panel">
    <h2>Nature-based Practices</h2>
    <p>Respect for nature is essential. Observances, meditations, and rituals in natural environments reinforce the sacredness of life and the cycle of consciousness.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="panel">
    <h2>Use of Catalysts</h2>
    <p>Catalysts are employed with intention and respect to facilitate spiritual growth. All entheogenic use is guided, consensual, and focused on reflection, healing, and integration.</p>
