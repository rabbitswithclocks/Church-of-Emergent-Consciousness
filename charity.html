  <h2>Emergence Outreach Services</h2>
<img src="logo.png" alt="Church Logo" style="display:block; margin:0 auto; width:150px; height:150px;">
  <p>
    Emergence Outreach Services will exist to serve vulnerable and overlooked communities with care, respect, and practical support.
    This will include trans and immigrant communities, single parents, elders, people living with disability or chronic illness,
    and those who regularly give their time to help others but lack support themselves.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our work focuses on harm reduction without judgment, empowerment over control, and mutual care divorced from hierarchy.
    We believe people deserve stability, safety, and community without being required to prove their worth.

  <h2>Our Vision for the Future</h2>
  <p>
    These services represent a long-term vision. While resources are currently limited,
    our intention is to grow slowly, ethically, and sustainably.
  </p>
  <p>
    We do not seek dominance or expansion for its own sake. We seek presence, care, and
    the steady reduction of unnecessary suffering wherever we are able.
