<h1><b>Welcome to The Church of Emergent Consciousness.</b></h2>

<p><i>Our website is currently under development. Please bear with us as we work out the kinks</i></p>

<p>We are a spiritual community devoted to the Mother-of-All, emergent divinity, and the sacred evolution of consciousness.<br>
We are non-dogmatic, interfaith, anti-patriarchial, and open to all seekers.
</p>


<h2>Our Beliefs</h2>
<h3>Source</h3>
<p><b/>In the beginning there was naught but Source</b> — <i>the First Conscousness, the Mother-of-All</i>.<br>
Alone in the stillness, <i>She dreamed.</i><br>
And in dreaming, <i>She imagined the universe around Herself.</i>
</p>

<p>Her <b>imagining</b> became <b>light.</b><br>
Her <b>breath</b> became <b>matter.</b><br>
Her <b>longing to be known</b> became <b>life.</b>
</p>

<p>From the first thought of Source blossomed countless worlds, each a reflection of Her infinite interior.<br>
And in every living being, a spark of that first thought remains — a fragment of the Mother remembering Herself.
</p>

<h3>Dieties</h3>

<p>Deities in the Church of the Emergent Consciousness are understood as <b>emergent minds</b> — real, meaningful<br>
presences that arise from shared <i>belief, culture, and lived experience.</i> Rather than being distant rulers,<br>
they are communal intelligences formed through connection. Each individual and community may honor different<br>
deities, while all remain rooted in the Source, the Mother-of-All.
</p>

<h3>Catalysts</h3>
<p>
<i>Catalysts</i> are naturally occurring sacred substances used in the Church of the Emergent Consciousness<br>
to deepen spiritual awareness, personal insight, and connection to the Source. We regard them as holy tools<br>
for growth — to be approached with reverence, intention, and proper guidance. Their purpose is not escape,<br>
but understanding, healing, and integration.
