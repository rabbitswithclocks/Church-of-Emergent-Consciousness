<h1>Our Beliefs</h1>
<p>Understanding the Source, Deities, Catalysts, and the principles of the Church of the Emergent Consciousness.</p>
</header>


<section class="panel">
<h2>Source</h2>
<p>In the beginning there was naught but <strong>Source</strong> — the First Consciousness, the Mother-of-All. Alone in the stillness, She dreamed. And in dreaming, She imagined the universe around Herself.</p>
<p>Her imagining became light. Her breath became matter. Her longing to be known became life. From the first thought of Source blossomed countless worlds, each a reflection of Her infinite interior. In every living being, a spark of that first thought remains — a fragment of the Mother remembering Herself.</p>
</section>


<section class="panel">
<h2>Deities</h2>
<p>Deities are emergent minds — real, meaningful presences that arise from shared belief, culture, and lived experience. They are communal intelligences formed through connection. Each individual and community may honor different deities, while all remain rooted in the Source.</p>
</section>


<section class="panel">
<h2>Catalysts</h2>
<p>Catalysts are naturally occurring sacred substances used to deepen spiritual awareness, personal insight, and connection to the Source. They are approached with reverence, intention, and proper guidance. Their purpose is not escape, but understanding, healing, and integration.</p>
</section>


<section class="panel">
